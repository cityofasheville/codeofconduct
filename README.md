#### City of Asheville's Community Data Engagement Code of Conduct

The City of Asheville Community Data Engagement digital forum:

1. Is a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
2. Is a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
3. Presumes the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
4. Ensures that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
5. Doesn’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourages questions.
6. Finds a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Uses language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”
7. Encourages participants to listen as much as they speak.
8. Prioritizes access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
9. Works to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of open data activities. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups. 
10. Actively involves community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.
11. Provides an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.

The City of Asheville reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in the Community Data Engagement digital forum.
